## Introduction
Early detection of diseases in chickens is crucial for maintaining healthy poultry. This project leverages image processing and machine learning to classify diseases based on fecal images.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of fecal images collected from various sources. Each image is labeled with the corresponding disease.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Chicken-Disease-Classification-using-Fecal-Image.git
cd Chicken-Disease-Classification-using-Fecal-Image
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To train the model, run:
```bash
python train.py
```
To evaluate the model, run:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## Model
The model is built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from the images and classify them into different disease categories.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test dataset. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the `results` directory.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request for any improvements or bug fixes.
